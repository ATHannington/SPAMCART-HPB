# SPAMCART-HPB

Work by Mr Andrew T. Hannington, Dr Maya Petkova, and Professor Ian Bonnell (St Andrews) on the O. Lomax & A. P. Whitworth SPAMCART algorithm 2016 (found here:http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/abs/2016MNRAS.461.3542L, and here: https://github.com/odlomax/spamcart-dev) as part of a University of St Andrews MPhys Theoretical Physics master's project.

Please forgive the very preliminary state of this work, poor standard of code, and bad practice. I hope my future work will reflect less poorly
